## Description

_The app takes a word from user input and finds how many times it occurs in a user supplied
body of text. User inputs these values in the home page, and then is taken to a results page, where the number of times the word is found in the text is displayed. There is no error message for no found occurrences. Repeat Counter returns only exact matches. Partial matches are not included, however hyphenated words, or words separated by symbols will be returned. For example:

Word: howdy
Text: Howdy-Do, pardner!

App will return 1 match_
